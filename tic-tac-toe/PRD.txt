## Component Architecture

### 5.1. Components Overview
1. **App Component**
   - Root component managing overall state and game logic.
2. **Header Component**
   - Displays the game title and virtual coin flip controls.
3. **GameBoard Component**
   - Renders the 3x3 grid and handles user interactions.
4. **Cell Component**
   - Represents each cell in the grid.
5. **StatusDisplay Component**
   - Shows current game status and outcome.
6. **Footer Component**
   - Contains additional controls like restart button.

### 5.2. State Management

## Sample Code

### 7.1. Game State Management (React Example)

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const initialBoard = Array(9).fill(null);

const App = () => {
  const [board, setBoard] = useState(initialBoard);
  const [isUserTurn, setIsUserTurn] = useState(true);
  const [gameStatus, setGameStatus] = useState('Ready to play');

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!isUserTurn && gameStatus === 'Your move') {
      const aiMove = computeAIMove(board);
      handleMove(aiMove, 'O');
    }
  }, [isUserTurn, gameStatus]);

  const computeAIMove = (currentBoard) => {
    // Implement Minimax or random selection for AI
    // For simplicity, return first available cell
    return currentBoard.findIndex(cell => cell === null);
  };

  const handleMove = (index, player) => {
    if (board[index] || gameStatus !== 'Your move') return;
    const newBoard = [...board];
    newBoard[index] = player;
    setBoard(newBoard);
    const result = checkGameResult(newBoard);
    if (result) {
      setGameStatus(result);
    } else {
      setIsUserTurn(!isUserTurn);
      setGameStatus(isUserTurn ? "AI's move" : 'Your move');
    }
  };

  const checkGameResult = (currentBoard) => {
    const winPatterns = [
      [0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8], // Rows
      [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8], // Columns
      [0,4,8], [2,4,6]           // Diagonals
    ];
    for (let pattern of winPatterns) {
      const [a, b, c] = pattern;
      if (currentBoard[a] && currentBoard[a] === currentBoard[b] && currentBoard[a] === currentBoard[c]) {
        return currentBoard[a] === 'X' ? 'You Win!' : 'AI Wins!';
      }
    }
    if (!currentBoard.includes(null)) return 'Draw!';
    return null;
  };

  const resetGame = () => {
    setBoard(initialBoard);
    setGameStatus('Ready to play');
    // Optionally trigger coin flip here
  };

  return (
    <div className="app">
      <h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
      <div className="game-status">{gameStatus}</div>
      <div className="game-board">
        {board.map((cell, index) => (
          <div key={index} className="cell" onClick={() => handleMove(index, 'X')}>
            {cell}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <button onClick={resetGame}>Restart Game</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### 7.2. Virtual Coin Flip Function

```javascript
const flipCoin = () => {
  try {
    const result = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'Heads' : 'Tails';
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Coin flip failed:', error);
    return 'Heads'; // Default fallback
  }
};
```
